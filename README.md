# Avg-TopK
The pooling layer is a layer used in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that takes the output feature map of the previous convolutional layer and reduces the feature maps to smaller sizes. The most common pooling methods are maximum and average pooling. Due to the fact that the pooling strategy reduces the amount of feature maps and model parameters, it is crucial to preserve the dominant information. In this study, a cost-effective new pooling method approach is proposed. The proposed pooling method is used by calculating the weighted average of the dominant features. The proposed pooling model has been developed to address the shortcomings of maximum pooling and average pooling. The proposed new Avg-TopK pooling model takes the pixels with the highest interaction as much as the specified K number and averages them. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the Avg-TopK pooling method achieves significantly higher image classification accuracy than conventional pooling methods.
